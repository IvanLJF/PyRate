# Usage

## PyRate Workflow

After installing PyRate, an executable program
``pyrate`` is created.

Use ``help`` for the different command line options:


    >> pyrate --help
    Usage: pyrate [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Options:
      -v, --verbosity [DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR]
                                      Level of logging
      --help                          Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      linrate
      postprocess
      prepifg


The ``pyrate`` program has four command line options corresponding to
different parts of the workflow.

1. ``prepifg``
2. ``correct``
3. ``linrate_timeseries``
4. ``postprocess``


### 1. prepifg: Preparing input interferograms

The first step of PyRate is to convert the GAMMA or ROI\_PAC format
unwrapped interferograms into geotiff format, followed by applying
multi-looking and cropping operations. These procedures are all
performed by ``pyrate prepifg`` command:


    >> pyrate prepifg --help
    Usage: pyrate prepifg [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

The ``prepfig`` command is used as follows:


    pyrate prepifg /path/to/config_file

The two major steps during the ``prepifg`` operation are described
below.



#### Data formatting: convert to geotiff

The ``prepifg`` command will determine the input format from the value
specified at the *processor:* keyword in the config file (0: ROI\_PAC;
1: GAMMA)

Each GAMMA geocoded unwrapped interferogram requires three header files to extract metadata required for data formatting: a geocoded DEM header file (*\*.dem.par*), and the master and slave epoch SLC parameter files (*\*.slc.par*).

The path and name of the DEM header file are specified in the config file under the *demHeaderFile:* keyword.

The SLC parameter files should be in the directory specified in the config file under the *slcFileDir:* keyword. SLC parameter files for a particular interferogram are found automatically by date string pattern matching.

Each ROI_PAC geocoded unwrapped interferogram  requires its own header/resource file (*\*.unw.rsc*) . These header files need to be stored in the same directory as the interferograms.  In addition, the geocoded DEM header file (*\*.dem.rsc*) is required and its path and name are specified in the config file under the *demHeaderFile:* keyword. The geographic projection in the parameter *DATUM:* is extracted from the DEM header file.


#### Image transformations: multi-looking and cropping

The ``prepifg`` command will also perform multi-looking (image
sub-sampling) and cropping of the input interferograms.

Two example config files are provided in the *configs/* directory, one each for ROI_PAC and GAMMA prepifg configuration.
Either config files can be used with ``prepifg``.


### 2. correct: Calculation of corrections

This is the core of the processing tools, handled by the ``correct``
command:


    pyrate correct path/to/config_file -c 3 -r 4

This command will perform xxxxxxxxxxx, and has the option to break the interferograms into tiles of ``r`` rows and
``c`` columns. For example, the above command will break the interferograms into 12 tiles and will produce 12 linear rate and time series products
corresponding to each tile.

The option of rows and columns can be used to create smaller ``tiles`` of
the full size interferograms. This enables large interferograms to be more easily be accommodated in system memory. The number of tiles chosen should be as small as possible that fits in the system memory.


### 3. linrate_timeseries: Linear rate and time series analysis


    >> pyrate linrate_timeseries --help
    Usage: pyrate linrate_timeseries [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

    Options:
      -r, --rows INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many rows
      -c, --cols INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many columns
      --help              Show this message and exit


The ``linrate_timeseries`` command will perform the time series and linear rate analysis:


    pyrate linrate_timeseries path/to/config_file -c 3 -r 4

This command also has the option to break the interferograms into tiles of ``r`` rows and
``c`` columns (see ``correct`` command above).



### 4. postprocess: Putting the tiles back together

The last step of the PyRate workflow is to re-assemble the tiles and save geotiff files of the final time series and linear rate products.


    >> pyrate postprocess --help
    Usage: pyrate postprocess [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

    Options:
      -r, --rows INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many rows
      -c, --cols INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many columns
      --help              Show this message and exit.

Make sure to use the same number of rows and columns with `postprocess` as
with `linrate_timeseries`:

    pyrate postprocess path/to/config_file -c 3 -r 4



## MPI Support

PyRate has been designed for High Performance Computers and instructions to use a HPC cluster can be found in the [hpc directory](hpc).


## Python Multi-threading Support

In addition to the MPI support for HPC, PyRate can be use standard
multi-threading simply by turning `parallel:  1` in the config file to take
advantage of multiple cores on a single PC.
